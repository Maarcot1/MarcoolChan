ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MarcoolChan and this is my first project for github, this small program is modifiable because it is in the programming language (.bat).
This program cleans up useless folders including the recycle bin. It also has a "TaskKiller" function or usually called a task finisher 
that will basically close all processes being used including drivers

âž¥Clean computer (Function "01")
;
The first and best function of the program. Designed to delete all junk and completely optimize your computer quickly and effectively.
This function deletes junk and temporary files from windows. The function clears the following locations

-temp
-recent
-prefetch
-Downloaded Program Files
-SoftwareDistribution\Download
-and clean the Trash can

Tambem ultiliza o comando : 
-"rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks"
Que otimiza o computador.

âž¥Turn off computer (function "02")
;
This function is customizable, you can instantly turn off the computer or be programmed to turn off in "03 hours" for example.
I'm working to make the customizable option even better. Currently it is only possible to modify this option in the program codes.

âž¥TaskKiller function's (Function "03")
;
It works like restarting a computer, but without the need to restart it. When performing this function, 
âš âš âš  The screen may flash and turn black for a few seconds. âš âš âš 
Wait a few minutes after using

âž¥About (function "04")
;
This will be an option that will be added in the future, currently in beta !

âž¥Exit (Function "05")
;
Close the program.

âž¥Program (function "06")
I'm working on it, currently in beta.
